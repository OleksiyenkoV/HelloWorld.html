		The Competition’s engine, codenamed S55, has two turbos, effectively making it operate as a pair of three-cylinders end-to-end.

		<p id="info2">As a consequence the puffers can be small and light so they spin up quickly to cut low-rev lag, but as there are two they can push plenty air at big revs.</p>
		<p id="info4">The old M2 engine (which was a single turbo) would go to 7,000rpm and was smooth doing it, but the new one will hit 7,600rpm. And it has 40bhp more at big revs.</p>
